Which metrics matter? And what do those numbers actually mean for real workloads? Benchmarking LLMs is not as straightforward as testing traditional AI models. LLMs have billions of parameters and their performance depends on many factors, such as hardware setup, memory bandwidth, quantization, KV-cache behavior, and parallelism strategy. Even small changes in configuration, prompt length, or user behavior can produce large differences in throughput, latency. Production workloads can shift unexpectedly, if users suddenly max out your context length when you weren't testing for it, performance will degrade significantly."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Once you've achieved acceptable response quality for your use case, performance becomes the critical next concern.
